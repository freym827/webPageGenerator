# webPageGenerator
A simple static web page designer with cool DOM interaction and a simple, easy to use, intuitive user experience, and powerful capabilities and implications. 

Choose from the 'Make a:' section to make an element. Click the element to change the style. Drag to position, drag to resize, or use the option box to change other features. Click the 'Show list of elements' button to access and view all available elements on the page. Delete an element with red button in the option box. Finally you may click the Show HTML button. It will show HTML you can copy and paste directly into an HTML file that will display your design in a browser.

Plenty of future possible development. More CSS options, upgraded design features, optimize user experience, and saving webpages to a database, or outputting html/css code to user.
