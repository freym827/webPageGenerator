# webPageGenerator
A simple static web page designer working with different DOM events, and a simple, easy to use, intuitive user experience, with powerful capabilities and implications. 

Choose from the 'Make a:' section to make an element. Click the element to change the style. Drag to position, drag to resize, or use the option box to change other features. You may name your elements. Click the 'Show list of elements' button to access and view all available elements on the page. Delete an element with red button in the option box. Finally you may click the Show HTML button. It will show HTML you can copy and paste directly into an HTML file that will display your design in a browser.

The biggest challenge in creating was deciding how the drag to resize an element would work. After thinking of a few options, I thought of making discrete 'bars' around the outside of the elements each acting of their own volition but coming together to create a malleable box. I wanted to make the user experience I would want when using this tool, including the double click function to hide/show the editing box, and having a clickable list of available elements that will highlight the clicked on element. It is designed to give the user control rather than stricter formats. 

Plenty of future possible development. More CSS options, upgraded design features, optimize user experience, and saving webpages to a database, or outputting html/css code to user.
